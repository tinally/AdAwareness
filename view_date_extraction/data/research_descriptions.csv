"The leading ladies have traded in the wealthy oil town of Denver for the locker room of a Sunday League football team for the Snickers advert\, which is about 'satisfying your inner diva'. She is then handed a chocolate bar and\, after taking a bite\, morphs into a male footballer to the catchphrase: 'You are not you when you are hungry.'\nMiss Beacham then sweeps in\, wearing a silver and lace gown with her hair piled high\, shouting angrily about being substituted during the match. The suggestion is that she too will need a chocolate bar to get back to her true male character and stop the diva behaviour."

This makes the 2012 National Team Kit our most environmentally-friendly ever. \n\nReclaimed\, discarded plastic bottles are melted down to produce new yarn\, which is converted into fabric. This recycling process saves raw materials and reduces energy consumption by an estimated 30% compared to manufacturing virgin polyester. Since 2010\, Nike Football has used an estimated 115 million recycled plastic bottles to create its high performance kits.

He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington\, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn\, New York\, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small\, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago\, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963\, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation\, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981\, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes\, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term\, local machine mayor. In 1983\, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration\, the city made major strides in affordable housing\, progressive taxation\, environmental protection\, child care\, women’s rights\, youth programs and the arts. In 1990\, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms\, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street\, the Patriot Act\, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006\, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator\,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate\, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010\, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015\, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues\, Senator Sanders has supported the working class\, women\, communities of color\, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment\, unions\, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL\, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal\, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act\, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\n\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues\, click here: https://berniesanders.com/issues/"

Across a plaza\, I saw a girl. For me\, it was love at first sight. From the moment I got to know her\, I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. In the years ahead\, whether I was changing baby diapers in Caracas\, Venezuela\, building a business in Miami or leading a state in Tallahassee\, Columba has been with me\, my best friend in all of life’s challenges and joys. Together\, we have built a family with three wonderful kids: Noelle\, George P.\, and Jeb Jr. Each of our kids has given us blessings\, and now they are giving us grandkids who seem to think I’m their personal climbing gym. They call me “Gampy\,” and\, together with their grandmother\, they keep me honest. I’m never as happy as I am when I’m with my family\, and that’s been true all my life.\n\nSo when I became governor\, I could be pretty relentless about getting the people’s business done. We defended and protected the most vulnerable in our society. I have always believed that as a nation\, we reveal our values by how we govern those moments when life is most vulnerable. So I rolled up my sleeves\, and working with the state Legislature\, we enacted reforms that helped businesses\, saving hundreds of millions of dollars a year– keeping jobs in the state\, and making sure that Florida’s economy could work for everyone.\n\nMy Administration attacked issues like that with the same focus. We cut taxes every year. Cut the state workforce by 13\,000. One year\, we enacted six laws aimed at protecting our citizens’ right to bear arms. My opponents called me a lot of names\, but the one I liked best was Veto Corleone. I vetoed over 2\,500 line items in the state’s budget. We assessed the problem\, took on the challenges and gave people the freedom to be creative and come up with solutions. When I was governor\, I always believed doing the people’s work was a great joy and an incredible responsibility. I knew that as governor\, I had the power to make things happen—not just give speeches. At the beginning of my second term\, a friend of mine gave me a clock\, which was ticking off the seconds\, minutes\, hours and days until my term of office was to end. It was a pretty good reminder that my ability to serve Florida was limited only by two things: time and how I used it. There were always more people to help. Jobs to create—we created 1.3 million of them. Small businesses were starting—we had more than 80\,000 small businesses start in Florida when I was in office. We had prosperity to launch—and Florida’s households were earning over $1\,000 more per year when I left office than when I began. We had a budget to balance\, and with the help of $2 billion in vetoes\, we achieved a AAA-bond rating.\n\nThat is a record I am proud to claim. That is a record I would like to bring to Washington\, D.C. And that’s why I am running for President. I’m Jeb Bush\, and I want your vote.\n\nJoin Team Jeb today: http://jeb.cm/1SDqVvt"

"What Happens After Smoking 60 Cigarettes\nAn experiment after smoking 60 cigarettes \nSmoking is one of the worst habit spread in people.  It's the one of the common of using drugs. . Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. \nThe history of smoking can be dated to as early as 5000 BC\, and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world. Early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies; as offerings to deities\, in cleansing rituals or to allow shamans and priests to alter their minds for purposes of divination or spiritual enlightenment. After the European exploration and conquest of the Americas\, the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world. In regions like India and Subsaharan Africa\, it merged with existing practices of smoking (mostly of cannabis). In Europe\, it introduced a new type of social activity and a form of drug intake which previously had been unknown."

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College\, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School\, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund\, going door to door in New Bedford\, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon\, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families\, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton\, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech\, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate\, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done\, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11\, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns\, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state\, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights\, internet freedom\, and rights and opportunities for women and girls\, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College\, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School\, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund\, going door to door in New Bedford\, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon\, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families\, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton\, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech\, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate\, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done\, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11\, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns\, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state\, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights\, internet freedom\, and rights and opportunities for women and girls\, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.

But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba)\, who bears the scars of Man\, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he’s ever known\, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery\, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley)\, and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way\, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don’t exactly have his best interests at heart\, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson)\, a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub\, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken)\, who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire. The all-star cast also includes Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf Raksha\, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack’s alpha male Akela. “The Jungle Book” seamlessly blends live-action with photorealistic CGI animals and environments\, using up-to-the-minute technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an enchanting and lush world. The wild adventure swings into theaters in 3D on April 15\, 2016."

"Rapper Young D heeft met zijn gouden stem een platencontract in de wacht gesleept. Onze held is hotter than hot en zijn maatjes zijn maar wat trots op het succes van hun homie. Bij een vet platencontract hoort natuurlijk een vette auto. Die past helemaal bij zijn nieuwe sterrenstatus. Maar dan blijkt dat zelfs Young D niet altijd totally in control is. Tijd om Even Apeldoorn te (r)appen. \n\nDeze 59e Even Apeldoorn Bellen commercial werd gefilmd in Los Angeles\, in de wijk Echo Park. Deze plek lijkt op de veel door rappers bezongen wijk Compton\, maar is een stuk veiliger. De rap die je hoort is gemaakt door de producer van hiphop-ster Kanye West. Courtney Richards (Young D) nam zelf de vocals van ‘Honk the horns’ voor zijn rekening. Op de set was er ook nog een typisch ‘Even Apeldoorn Bellen’ moment. In take 6 rolde de auto van Young D de heuvel af\, maar raakte onbedoeld een geparkeerde auto.\n\nOver Centraal Beheer:\n\nCentraal Beheer biedt particuliere en zakelijke klanten persoonlijk contact\, zekerheid en gemak.

"To mark World Water Day\, on March 22nd Solidarités International and its agency BDDP Unlimited will roll out a campaign to build awareness of the scourge of undrinkable  water. \n\nToday\, it is estimated that 3.6 million people\, including 1.5 million children under the age of 5\, die every year of diseases borne by unhealthy water\, making it the world's leading cause of death.\n\nYet the public isn't aware of it and political leaders do not demonstrate the drive it takes to end the terrible deaths. The campaign calls on journalists to spread awareness of this scourge and appeal to readers to sign a petition that will be personally handed to the French president during the 6th World Water Forum in March 2012.\n\nTo evoke the silent and invisible threat of unhealthy water\, BDDP Unlimited opted for a minimalist approach that is both visually appealing and surprising\, using water and ink exclusively. The spot shows the power of ink to reveal the invisible.\n\nThe spot\, created by BDDP Unlimited\, produced by Hush and directed by Clément Beauvais\, a young director\, illustrator\, musician and photographer. His multiple talents and mastery of various techniques enabled him to both create the drawings and direct the spot.\n\nThe campaign will be seen from mid-March on TV\, in cinemas\, on the Internet and in print. A dedicated web site\, www.votregouttedeau.org\, will gather signatures for the petition."

He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington\, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn\, New York\, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small\, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago\, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963\, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation\, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981\, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes\, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term\, local machine mayor. In 1983\, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration\, the city made major strides in affordable housing\, progressive taxation\, environmental protection\, child care\, women’s rights\, youth programs and the arts. In 1990\, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms\, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street\, the Patriot Act\, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006\, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator\,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate\, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010\, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015\, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues\, Senator Sanders has supported the working class\, women\, communities of color\, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment\, unions\, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL\, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal\, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act\, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues\, click here: https://berniesanders.com/issues/"

"We talked to Sally Knapp\, a triathlete and a mother\, about her Sleep Number bed and how she uses her sleep tracking app to help her train for triathlons and marathons. Here’s what she says: “My name is Sally Knapp\, I’m a hair stylist\, I’m a triathlete\, I’m a mother\, my Sleep Number setting is 60 and last night my SleepIQ score was 88!”\n\n“I went up to Nashville over my birthday and I did the Nashville Half Marathon – that was fun. It was on my birthday\, so about 50\,000 people showed up to celebrate my birthday. I went out there and just pushed myself as hard as my body would allow me and I had so much fun.”\n\n“I love race day; I love getting up early\, making my coffee\, heading out there early – ya know\, thinking gosh\, that guy’s 85 and he’s out here doing that\, that kid’s 14 and he’s out here. It’s just incredible\, everybody’s outside enjoying beautiful nature just having fun. And then you come around the bend and see the finish line and just give it all you have.”\n\n“And I love post-race; you’re on a high all day long and your kids think you won because you come home with a medal. Post-race I love to adjust my bed to soften it a little bit. I feel my hips are a little tight from all of the racing and the biking and the jarring of the running. Diving into a softer bed\, it’s just so comfortable.”\n\n“It’s really fun to look on your app\, on your device\, and look at how well you slept the night before. For some reason just knowing that number\, that you IQ was better than your husband’s\, you’re like my day is going to rock today. I love my Sleep Number. I don’t think that there is another bed that could give me the quality sleep that I have.”\n\nFind a Sleep Number® mattress store near you to find out how Sleep Number can help if you're having trouble sleeping: http://www.sleepnumber.com/find-mattress-stores\n\nHear unbiased reviews from real people experiencing real rest with Sleep Number® by going to our channel & subscribing:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHfTRz3NU-w&list=PLR6a2QUEJa7DMd1xgimde_ql4dPadh_TI \n\nLike us on Facebook to get the latest news on Sleep Number®: http://www.facebook.com/SleepNumber"

"Together\, we can create a political revolution that transforms the economy and a democracy that works for all of us\, not just the powerful few.\n\n---------\n★ Join the political revolution at www.berniesanders.com \n\n★ Connect with Bernie:\nFacebook → https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/\nTwitter → https://twitter.com/berniesanders\nInstagram → https://www.instagram.com/berniesanders/\nTumblr → http://berniesanders.tumblr.com/\nSnapchat → bernie.sanders\n\n★ About Bernie:\nBernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington\, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn\, New York\, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small\, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago\, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963\, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation\, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981\, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes\, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term\, local machine mayor. In 1983\, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration\, the city made major strides in affordable housing\, progressive taxation\, environmental protection\, child care\, women’s rights\, youth programs and the arts. In 1990\, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms\, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street\, the Patriot Act\, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006\, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator\,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate\, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010\, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015\, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues\, Senator Sanders has supported the working class\, women\, communities of color\, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment\, unions\, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL\, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal\, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act\, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues\, click here: https://berniesanders.com/issues/"

"Never Drive or Walk into Flood Waters - Turn Around Don’t Drown! \n\nFlooding is one of the leading causes of weather related fatalities in the U.S. On average\, flooding claims nearly 90 lives each year.  More than half of these deaths occur in motor vehicles when people attempt to drive through flooded roadways.  This happens because people underestimate the force and power of water\, especially when it is moving.  \n\nJust six inches of fast-moving water can knock over and carry off an adult. Twelve inches of water can float a small car. If that water is moving\, it can carry that car away. Eighteen to twenty-four inches of flowing water can carry away most vehicles\, including large SUVs. It is impossible to tell the exact depth of water covering a roadway or the condition of the road below the water. This is especially true at night when your vision is more limited.  It is never safe to drive or walk through flood waters. Any time you come to a flooded road\, walkway\, or path\, follow this simple rule: Turn Around Don’t Drown. \n\nFor more information and flood safety tips\, visit www.floodsafety.noaa.gov.\nDownload in HD (1920x1080): http://go.usa.gov/xW5yQ"

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College\, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School\, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund\, going door to door in New Bedford\, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon\, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families\, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton\, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech\, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate\, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done\, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11\, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns\, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state\, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights\, internet freedom\, and rights and opportunities for women and girls\, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she want to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.

"Welcome to the jungle. Take a look around in this  360 experience!\n\nDisney’s The Jungle Book opens in theatres April 15 in 3D! Get tickets: http://di.sn/6008BjFgq\n\nDirected by Jon Favreau (“Iron Man”)\, based on Rudyard Kipling’s timeless stories and inspired by Disney’s classic animated film\, “The Jungle Book” is an all-new live-action epic adventure about Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi)\, a man-cub who’s been raised by a family of wolves. But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba)\, who bears the scars of Man\, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he’s ever known\, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery\, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley)\, and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way\, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don’t exactly have his best interests at heart\, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson)\, a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub\, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken)\, who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire. The all-star cast also includes Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf Raksha\, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack’s alpha male Akela. “The Jungle Book” seamlessly blends live-action with photorealistic CGI animals and environments\, using up-to-the-minute technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an enchanting and lush world. The wild adventure swings into theaters in 3D on April 15\, 2016. \n\nLike The Jungle Book on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyJungleBook\nFollow The Jungle Book on Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheJungleBook\nFollow The Jungle Book on Instagram: https://instagram.com/disneythejunglebook"

Interactive Entertainment revealed today gameplay featuring everyone’s favorite Mystery\, Inc. characters in LEGO Dimensions\, the upcoming entertainment experience that merges physical LEGO brick building with interactive console gameplay.

"Celebs Who've Dissed Taylor Swift ►► http://youtu.be/jQKa22tRiV8\nFor all your music needs ►► http://bit.ly/ClevverMusic \n\nWhat do you get when you mix Taylor Swift\, soda pop\, and a whole bunch of cute cats? Not only my personal view of heaven\, but the latest Diet coke commercial where T-Swift is previewing new music.\nYup\, not only did we FINALLY get to hear “Out of the Woods” earlier this week\, but Tay is giving a sneak peek at another track off her upcoming album 1989 courtesy this new Diet Coke commercial. \nAnd spoiler alert\, it’s awesome. Take a listen for yourself.\n\nSo the video starts off with Taylor sipping some DC\, as she’s playing with some kittens. And the more soda she drinks\, the more cats show up. We’re not really sure why\, but who are we to question the concept? All we know is its adorable\, and the song sounds pretty good too. We’re not 100% sure\, but it sounds like she’s singing something along the lines of “that’s just how it works”?\nThis isn’t the only new music she’s teasing\, as Taylor also recently posted an Instagram with some lyrics off her upcoming album 1989. The drawing featured a cityscape and reads:\n“It’s a new soundtrack\, I could dance to this beat…forevermore.”\nUgh\, come on Taylor – you’re killing us here! And just in case you for some reason don’t have this date already marked on your calendar\, Taylor’s new album 1989 drops on October 27. \nAre you digging Taylor’s new commercial with the world’s most adorable kittens in the backdrop?

"The sequel to the worldwide smash hit “Olympus Has Fallen\,” a non-stop\, suspenseful action thriller that delivers high-octane excitement through a heightened sense of authenticity. The visceral intensity springs from a timely premise: after the British Prime Minister passes away\, his funeral becomes a target of a terrorist organization to destroy some of the world’s most powerful leaders\, devastate the British capital\, and unleash a terrifying vision of the future. The only hope of stopping it rests on the shoulders of the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) and his formidable Secret Service head (Gerard Butler)\, and an English MI-6 agent (Charlotte Riley) who rightly trusts no one. Morgan Freeman also stars as the Vice President of the United States.\n\nwww.LondonHasFallen.com\nhttps://twitter.com/londonfallen\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LondonHasFallenOfficial/"

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College\, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School\, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund\, going door to door in New Bedford\, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon\, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families\, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton\, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech\, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate\, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done\, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11\, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns\, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state\, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights\, internet freedom\, and rights and opportunities for women and girls\, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she want to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.

"Wall Street showers Washington with contributions\, so they answer to Wall Street. Only one candidate is fully funded by you: Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n-----\n\n★ Join the political revolution at www.berniesanders.com \n\n★ Connect with Bernie:\nFacebook → https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/\nTwitter → https://twitter.com/berniesanders\nInstagram → https://www.instagram.com/berniesanders/\nTumblr → http://berniesanders.tumblr.com/\nSnapchat → bernie.sanders\n\n★ https://connect.berniesanders.com → The campaign’s official social media organizing tool\n\n★ About Bernie:\nBernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington\, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn\, New York\, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small\, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago\, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963\, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation\, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981\, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes\, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term\, local machine mayor. In 1983\, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration\, the city made major strides in affordable housing\, progressive taxation\, environmental protection\, child care\, women’s rights\, youth programs and the arts. In 1990\, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms\, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street\, the Patriot Act\, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006\, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator\,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate\, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010\, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015\, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues\, Senator Sanders has supported the working class\, women\, communities of color\, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment\, unions\, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL\, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal\, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act\, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\n\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues\, click here: https://berniesanders.com/issues/"

"Get classic TV commercials on DVD: http://astore.amazon.com/retroload-20\nHai Karate was a budget aftershave on sale in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1960s and the 1970s\, and derives its notability from its position as an icon of nostalgia. It was famously used by teenagers as their first scent\, competing with other market leaders Brut\, Denim and Old Spice. As a unique marketing ploy\, in the early days each bottle of Hai Karate came with a small self-defense instruction booklet\, to help wearers defend themselves against women.\nHai Karate is also fondly remembered for its television adverts\, which featured a stereotypical nerd covering himself in the substance and being seduced by a female passer-by played by Valerie Leon of Carry On films fame. The advertising catch phrase was \Be careful how you use it\""."

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College\, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School\, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund\, going door to door in New Bedford\, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon\, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families\, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton\, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech\, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate\, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done\, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11\, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns\, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state\, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights\, internet freedom\, and rights and opportunities for women and girls\, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she want to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.

Ask them to stop using palm oil from forest destruction.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Thanks to the staggering public support for our international Dove campaign in April 2008\, Unilever has now agreed to play their part in saving the Paradise Forests of South East Asia. As the biggest single buyer of palm oil in the world\, Unilever has a special responsibility to help clean up the industry that's behind so much forest destruction.\n\nThey have agreed to support the call by Greenpeace for an immediate moratorium on deforestation for palm oil plantations. They have also agreed to urgently contact other major companies calling on them to support the moratorium.\n\nThis is the first success in a broader campaign to secure real change on the ground in South East Asia -- to stop the palm oil industry from destroying the Paradise Forests. Greenpeace campaigners will work with Unilever for th next six months (starting May 2008) to bring together a major coalition of companies to make the moratorium a reality. We will see at the end of this period how things are progressing and if we need to change our campaign approach.\n\n\nAbout the music:\nThe song's called \There They Go\"".

"As president\, Bernie Sanders will take on Wall Street by breaking up the big banks\, closing tax loopholes and making them pay their fair share.\n\n---------\n★ Join the political revolution at www.berniesanders.com \n\n★ Connect with Bernie:\nFacebook → https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/\nTwitter → https://twitter.com/berniesanders\nInstagram → https://www.instagram.com/berniesanders/\nTumblr → http://berniesanders.tumblr.com/\nSnapchat → bernie.sanders\n\n★ About Bernie:\nBernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington\, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn\, New York\, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small\, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago\, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963\, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation\, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981\, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes\, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term\, local machine mayor. In 1983\, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration\, the city made major strides in affordable housing\, progressive taxation\, environmental protection\, child care\, women’s rights\, youth programs and the arts. In 1990\, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms\, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street\, the Patriot Act\, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006\, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator\,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate\, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010\, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015\, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues\, Senator Sanders has supported the working class\, women\, communities of color\, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment\, unions\, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL\, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal\, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act\, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues\, click here: https://berniesanders.com/issues/"

"The Baku City Circuit hosted Formula 1 2016 FORMULA 1 GRAND PRIX OF EUROPE for the first time ever. Another chance to go down in history: Nico Rosberg and Mercedes seized the opportunity to secure the first grand prix victory in Azerbaijan\, Williams dominated the DHL Fastest Pit Stop Award again\, producing one of the fastest Formula 1 pit stops ever!\n\nEight races\, eight fastest pit stops: Williams left the competition no chance in Baku. Three of the four fastest stops went to the team from Grove. Only Red Bull Racing got in the way of a Williams hat-trick with the stop for Daniel Ricciardo.\n\nBut Williams not only achieved the fastest pit stop in the still nascent Formula 1 history of Azerbaijan\, the team also matched the previous world record with a record stop of 1.92 seconds (Felipe Massa)! The previous top time was a stop by Red Bull driver Mark Webber in the 2013 United States Grand Prix\, also in the record time of 1.92 seconds.\n\nA look at the timesheet shows just how much the unbeaten Williams series of best times is driving the other teams to achieve similar top performances: 21 of the 33 pit stops during the 2016 FORMULA 1 GRAND PRIX OF EUROPE were below the magic three-second benchmark figure! This shows once again that the #GreatIsInTheDetail motto could not be more apt where Formula 1 pit stops are concerned!"

"The sequel to the worldwide smash hit “Olympus Has Fallen\,” a non-stop\, suspenseful action thriller that delivers high-octane excitement through a heightened sense of authenticity. The visceral intensity springs from a timely premise: after the British Prime Minister passes away\, his funeral becomes a target of a terrorist organization to destroy some of the world’s most powerful leaders\, devastate the British capital\, and unleash a terrifying vision of the future. The only hope of stopping it rests on the shoulders of the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) and his formidable Secret Service head (Gerard Butler)\, and an English MI-6 agent (Charlotte Riley) who rightly trusts no one. Morgan Freeman also stars as the Vice President of the United States.\n\nwww.LondonHasFallen.com\nhttps://twitter.com/londonfallen\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LondonHasFallenOfficial/"

"Subscribe to ITN News: http://bit.ly/1bmWO8h\nA shocking road safety advert shows a car smash through a wall and kill a classroom of children. The video starts with children at school playing and preparing to leave for a school trip\, whilst a man grabs his breakfast at home and heads out in his car. As the children play in the park\, we see the man lose control of his car and crash through a wall. However\, on the other side of the wall are the children. The car flips through the air\, landing on them and crushing them instantly. The Northern Ireland road safety ad was made to highlight the dangers of speeding after figures showed 28 children have died from it since 2000. Road safety minister Mark Durkan insisted the advert was 'sensitive'.

"On 27 February 2013\, the TAC launched a new mass media public education campaign targeting distracted road users. The campaign highlights the dangers of taking your eyes off the road for just two seconds.\n\nInternational research into road user distractions has established the 'eyes off the road' time theory as a major contributor to crash risks resulting in trauma. \n\nThe 'eyes off the road' time is generally defined as two seconds plus\, the average person's reaction time to an event is 1.8 seconds and this is factored into crash probability and injury outcome severity. That means nearly four seconds can pass before the average 'distracted' driver can react.\n\nWith more devices and distractions available to us than ever\, the latest campaign shows how quickly inattention can end in disaster. \nThe campaign will appear on a number of different media including TV\, radio\, outdoor\, online and ambient.\n\nhttp://www.tacsafety.com.au/campaigns/distractions\n\nTransport Accident Commission Victoria.\nhttps://www.tac.vic.gov.au\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TransportAccidentCommission \nhttps://twitter.com/TACVictoria \n\n======================\n\n\Copyright in the material on this website is owned by the TAC and may only be used for non-commercial personal or educational purposes.

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College\, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School\, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund\, going door to door in New Bedford\, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon\, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families\, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton\, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech\, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate\, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done\, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11\, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns\, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state\, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights\, internet freedom\, and rights and opportunities for women and girls\, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.

He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington\, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn\, New York\, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small\, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago\, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963\, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation\, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981\, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes\, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term\, local machine mayor. In 1983\, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration\, the city made major strides in affordable housing\, progressive taxation\, environmental protection\, child care\, women’s rights\, youth programs and the arts. In 1990\, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms\, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street\, the Patriot Act\, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006\, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator\,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate\, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010\, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015\, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues\, Senator Sanders has supported the working class\, women\, communities of color\, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment\, unions\, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL\, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal\, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act\, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues\, click here: https://berniesanders.com/issues/"

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College\, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School\, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund\, going door to door in New Bedford\, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon\, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families\, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton\, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech\, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate\, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done\, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11\, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns\, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state\, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights\, internet freedom\, and rights and opportunities for women and girls\, LGBT people and young people all around the globe.

Do you think it is your best yet?\n\nIt was definitely more difficult than my other works\, it was difficult to find the perfect position and it was quite hard for the models to hold the positions\, from time to time they needed a break. Also it was difficult because the wolf is a mammalian and it has a coat\, which is much more difficult to paint and to make seem realistic than for example the skin of an amphibian or a reptil.\n\nThe painting was one of my longest as well. From the beginning to the final photo I spend 8 hours in my studio. In the middle we spent at least 1 hour to correct the position again and again\, the pure painting time was about 6 hours.\n\nThe first sketch took me just a few minutes\, but it took 4 hours to check out the position with the models before the actual painting\, it was my longest position test ever.\n\nIt is hard to say if the wolf is my best yet\, but I am sure it is not less spectacular than my other animal illusions. Besides a wolf is an animal which generally attracts a lot of people.\n\nHow did you make the background of this work?\n\nThe background is painted with acrylic color on cardboard\, partly with brushes\, partly with spray cans. It hangs on the wall and continues on the ground.\n\nWhat has the feedback from people been?\n\nActually many of the peolple who already saw the wolf say that it is my best work. Generally everybody likes it. People are fascinated and they say that it is even more difficult to find the people than in my other works. Recently I showed the wolf in public for the 1st time at my exhibition in Switzerland and it emerged as \the star\"" of the exhibition.\n\nHow do you make your animals so realistic?\n\nI draw and paint since my early childhood and animals always belonged to my main motives and main themes. I always loved animals and apart from painting them I watched out for them in the nature\"

He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington\, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn\, New York\, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small\, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago\, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963\, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation\, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981\, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes\, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term\, local machine mayor. In 1983\, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration\, the city made major strides in affordable housing\, progressive taxation\, environmental protection\, child care\, women’s rights\, youth programs and the arts. In 1990\, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms\, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street\, the Patriot Act\, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006\, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator\,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate\, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010\, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015\, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues\, Senator Sanders has supported the working class\, women\, communities of color\, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment\, unions\, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL\, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal\, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act\, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\n\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues\, click here: https://berniesanders.com/issues/"
