Some things never go out of style.\n\nShaq and Kemp\u2019s tight shorts from decades past are decidedly old school, and not in a good way. Reebok Kamikaze I, though, have that old school design and bold colors that will turn the heads of everyone who lived through the \u201890s. First worn by the legendary Shawn Kemp in 1994, the Kamikaze was designed to mirror The Reign Man\u2019s outgoing persona and groundbreaking athleticism.\n\nClick the link above to check out Reebok Classic\u2019s latest colorways and variations on the Kamikaze silhouette.","categoryId":"17"}

My recommendation is to track down the people who own the rights and bug them to release the episodes, which will no doubt be in better condition than this one.\n\nUpdated Frequently Asked Questions:\n\nQ1. Can you post ___?\nA1. These are commercials from old VHS tapes my family recorded off the television. I have nothing to do with making them, so what I don't have, I can't post. Whining will not spontaneously make me have something I don't have. If I *do* have it, I will post it eventually (excepting certain videos: see Q5 below). Be patient\u2014I have a LOT of tapes to go through and not so much free time.\n\nQ2. Can I download these?\nA2. To the Google! Search for \"download Youtube\" or something to that effect\u2014that'll be faster than anything I could do for you.\n\nQ3. When was ___ produced?\/When did ___ first broadcast?\nA3. If I don't state it in the description, I have no idea. Almost none of my tapes have any kind of time stamp or date reference. Also, many commercials aired for years, and I have no way to tell if the commercial is \"old\" or \"new\" at the time of the recording. (Google is your friend.)\n\nQ4. Will you follow me\/watch my channel\/visit my website\/etc.?\nA4. No. I already don't have time to record videos. Following\/etc. would just take away from that time.\n\nQ5. Did you delete this video?\nA5. At least one of my posts had been removed due to copyright violation. Why just the one(s) and not the others? I suspect some companies appreciate the free advertising. However, the type of content in the removed post(s) is something I will avoid in the future.\n\nQ6. Did you delete this comment?\nA6. While I don't mind if you poke a little fun at something in a video, I draw the line at outright hostilities, such as defaming the actors or insulting other users. I'm not here to censor anyone, but neither am I here to read flame wars aimed entirely at making others angry for no good reason. If you made a comment that referred to a hostile comment, I may delete yours as well just for reasons of simplicity.\n\nQ7. Why did you post ___? It's old\/stupid\/[insert derogatory comment here]!\nA7. Why not? The alternative is not posting. I suppose I could always reclaim my free time that way, sure, and you would just have to bother someone else. Your choice.","categoryId":"24"}

Each episode contained 2 or 3 different segments, each one focusing on a child from a different country (what their life was like, interests, etc...). The apparent goal of the program was to promote cultural awareness\/understanding.  I believe themes like ecology were also discussed.\nThe show encouraged viewers to become \"pen pals\" with other viewers from different parts of the world, and facilitated this with a segment during each show.\nAs far as I know, the show hasn't been shown (at least in the US) since it originally aired.  I've heard that some of the children that became pen pals kept in touch for years (even to present day).\nThis version of the show's intro was from a later season and is a different song than was originally used*.  I don't know when the change was made but both seem to be remembered fondly depending on when you watched.

He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont\u2019s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard \u201cBernie\u201d Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s historic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city\u2019s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women\u2019s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a \u201cpractical and successful legislator,\u201d Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus\u2019 ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues, click here: https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/","categoryId":"25"}

There's more than a hint of Toyota Previa about its profile and the headlamp clusters seem to have been lifted from a Land Rover Discovery. There's a weird bustle rear end and a suspicious lean towards the front, as if the rear wheels are a couple of inches larger.\n\nIt\u2019s also equipped with a hilarious array of comedy extras as the spoof Albanian car ad demonstrates. Door handles double as cup holders, there\u2019s a drinking fountain, a CB radio and a detachable steering wheel. The car also has two sets of door mirrors front and rear producing a double reflection effect so the driver can check his hair and two fuel filler caps.","categoryId":"2"}

He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont\u2019s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard \u201cBernie\u201d Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s historic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city\u2019s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women\u2019s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a \u201cpractical and successful legislator,\u201d Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus\u2019 ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\n\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues, click here: https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/","categoryId":"25"}

The advert was launched on Monday 28 June, and was broadcast for the first time that night during coverage of Brazil's World Cup match. It will continue to be shown over the next 9 weeks on STV, Channel 4 and Channel 5.\r\n\r\n\"Not Ever\" addresses women-blaming attitudes towards rape such as claims that dressing provocatively, being drunk or flirting with men are contributory factors. Its hard-hitting approach is intended to make people stop in their tracks, and to shake out and challenge ingrained prejudices many people have towards women who have been raped.\r\n\r\nRecent research reveals that almost one in five Scots believe a woman is partially to blame for being raped if she is wearing revealing clothing - a survey of 1,040 Scots carried out by Cello MRUK in February 2010 for the Scottish Government found that:\r\n\u2022 23 per cent think  a woman can be at least partly responsible if she is drunk at the time of the attack\r\n\u2022 17 per cent  thought that a woman bore some responsibility if she wore revealing clothing\r\n\u2022 15 per cent say there should be some burden of responsibility for rape if the women is flirting\r\n\u2022 8 per cent think rape can be the woman's fault if she is known to have had many sexual partners\r\n\r\nThese attitudes can make it difficult for women to speak out about being raped, because of fear of being blamed for what has happened.  There are also significant concerns about the impact these attitudes might have on rape survivors' ability to access justice, in terms of attitudes which jury members might hold.\r\n\r\nAlthough many people genuinely believe they wouldn't judge a rape victim by what they wear, how drunk they were, or if they had been flirting all night, they often actually do; particularly when sitting as a juror in court. Not Ever wants to prompt people to keep their judgments in check and to remember that there's only one person who is responsible for rape and it's not the victim. It doesn't matter what you wear, how many sexual partners you've had, or if you're out getting drunk with friends - no one deserves to be raped - ever. \r\n\r\nA new campaign website has been set up to allow people to share their thoughts and seek support at www.notever.co.uk , and people can also show support for Not Ever on the campaign's Facebook page at http:\/\/bit.ly\/blMIu2 .\r\nThere is also a Not Ever Twitter stream: @Not_Ever to keep people updated with the progress of the campaign.","categoryId":"29"}

Across a plaza, I saw a girl. For me, it was love at first sight. From the moment I got to know her, I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. In the years ahead, whether I was changing baby diapers in Caracas, Venezuela, building a business in Miami or leading a state in Tallahassee, Columba has been with me, my best friend in all of life\u2019s challenges and joys. Together, we have built a family with three wonderful kids: Noelle, George P., and Jeb Jr. Each of our kids has given us blessings, and now they are giving us grandkids who seem to think I\u2019m their personal climbing gym. They call me \u201cGampy,\u201d and, together with their grandmother, they keep me honest. I\u2019m never as happy as I am when I\u2019m with my family, and that\u2019s been true all my life.\n\nSo when I became governor, I could be pretty relentless about getting the people\u2019s business done. We defended and protected the most vulnerable in our society. I have always believed that as a nation, we reveal our values by how we govern those moments when life is most vulnerable. So I rolled up my sleeves, and working with the state Legislature, we enacted reforms that helped businesses, saving hundreds of millions of dollars a year\u2013 keeping jobs in the state, and making sure that Florida\u2019s economy could work for everyone.\n\nMy Administration attacked issues like that with the same focus. We cut taxes every year. Cut the state workforce by 13,000. One year, we enacted six laws aimed at protecting our citizens\u2019 right to bear arms. My opponents called me a lot of names, but the one I liked best was Veto Corleone. I vetoed over 2,500 line items in the state\u2019s budget. We assessed the problem, took on the challenges and gave people the freedom to be creative and come up with solutions. When I was governor, I always believed doing the people\u2019s work was a great joy and an incredible responsibility. I knew that as governor, I had the power to make things happen\u2014not just give speeches. At the beginning of my second term, a friend of mine gave me a clock, which was ticking off the seconds, minutes, hours and days until my term of office was to end. It was a pretty good reminder that my ability to serve Florida was limited only by two things: time and how I used it. There were always more people to help. Jobs to create\u2014we created 1.3 million of them. Small businesses were starting\u2014we had more than 80,000 small businesses start in Florida when I was in office. We had prosperity to launch\u2014and Florida\u2019s households were earning over $1,000 more per year when I left office than when I began. We had a budget to balance, and with the help of $2 billion in vetoes, we achieved a AAA-bond rating.\n\nThat is a record I am proud to claim. That is a record I would like to bring to Washington, D.C. And that\u2019s why I am running for President. I\u2019m Jeb Bush, and I want your vote.\n\nJoin Team Jeb today: http:\/\/jeb.cm\/1SDqVvt","categoryId":"22"}

It's the one of the common of using drugs. . Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. \nThe history of smoking can be dated to as early as 5000 BC, and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world. Early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies; as offerings to deities, in cleansing rituals or to allow shamans and priests to alter their minds for purposes of divination or spiritual enlightenment. After the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world. In regions like India and Subsaharan Africa, it merged with existing practices of smoking (mostly of cannabis). In Europe, it introduced a new type of social activity and a form of drug intake which previously had been unknown.","categoryId":"24"}

Left to fend for himself after his mother abandons him at Bullworth to go on her fifth honeymoon, Jimmy has a whole year at Bullworth ahead of him, working his way up the social ladder of this demented institution of supposed learning, standing up for what he thinks is right and taking on the liars, cheats and snobs who are the most popular members of the student body and faculty. If Jimmy can survive the school year and outsmart his rivals, he could rule the school. \r\n\r\nReady yourself for a hilarious return to campus living with Bully, the outrageously funny debut title from Rockstar Vancouver, available exclusively for PlayStation\u00ae2 computer entertainment system this October.","categoryId":"24"}

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state\u2019s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that \u201chuman rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all\u201d\u2014inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women\u2019s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn\u2019t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she\u2019s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton\u2019s YouTube Channel.

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state\u2019s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that \u201chuman rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all\u201d\u2014inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women\u2019s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn\u2019t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she\u2019s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton\u2019s YouTube Channel.

Your comments won't be allowed on this video.  This is for people who need it and your opinions on me are irrelevant.  This is for the people who are attacked regularly and hearing me or the video being attacked isn't what they need.  I know you think your points are valid, but they really aren't.  You just use name calling and rumor spreading to make yourself look important.  That isn't for here.  Comment a different video where you will be ignored.\n\nLet me go on record for the billionth time for you all as well.  I NEVER CALLED REGAN WINGO A HORSE!  I know it's the favorite phrase of people who have nothing else to say, but find something true to use as an argument.\n\nAnother little note for the people who like to talk about what pics have been stolen and used on Instagram and Twitter, the ones showing cleavage or my belly or top of my underwear, or short shorts.  Those are photos and that's all.  When you start throwing the words \"slut\" and \"whore\" around, you are making a lot of assumptions about me that you know nothing about.  By the way, it isn't possible to categorize someone as those things based upon one factor.  Also, you should be thinking about what kind of people distribute those pics when they haven't been on any social media for a long, long time and only briefly then.  Who saves those pics for a rainy day?  Sounds like someone pretty obsessive and creepy to me.  Some of these pics were never on social media and were only in the hands of people like my most recent ex bf and somehow miraculously showed up in public.  Of course, he has no idea how it happened.  But I know and he actually does know.  I kept the pics of him private, like a trustworthy person would do.  I wouldn't break that kind of trust.  I have NEVER taken nude photos.  All photos you see are photoshopped or not even me at all!  People will try anything to make me look bad, but fail.\n\nI WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW THAT I HAVE READ EVERY COMMENT ON THIS VIDEO AND WILL KEEP DOING IT.  I appreciate that you understand that this is about us, not just me.  I love you all for watching.\n\nYou mean something.  We all mean something.\n\nI really hope this video is helping people.  That was my intent.  I do truly fight with this type of hate every day but this is really more for the people who are struggling with it and not winning the battle.  I want them to get through it.  I know they can.\n\nhttp:\/\/tacolol.tumblr.com\nhttp:\/\/facebook.com\/kshabrinley\nhttp:\/\/twitter.com\/kshaclark\ninstagram: @acaciabrinley\ngifboom: @acaciabrinley","categoryId":"27"}

Watch the new trailer for Frozen Fever only in theatres with Cinderella! Get tickets today: http:\/\/di.sn\/6001Lmfb\n\nIn \u201cFrozen Fever,\u201d it's Anna's birthday and Elsa and Kristoff are determined to give her the best celebration ever,\nbut when Elsa catches a cold, her powers may put more than just the party at risk. \n\nThe story of \"Cinderella\" follows the fortunes of young Ella (Lily James) whose merchant father remarries following the death of her mother. Eager to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and her daughters Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) and Drisella (Sophie McShera) into the family home. But, when Ella's father unexpectedly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella, Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother's dying words and to \"have courage and be kind.\" She will not give in to despair nor despise those who mistreat her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince, not merely an apprentice at the Palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul. It appears her fortunes may be about to change when the Palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball, raising Ella's hopes of once again encountering the charming Kit (Richard Madden). Alas, her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress. But, as in all good fairy tales, help is at hand, and a kindly beggar woman (Helena Bonham-Carter) steps forward and -- armed with a pumpkin and a few mice -- changes Cinderella's life forever.\n\nWebsite: http:\/\/www.disney.com\/Cinderella\nFacebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Cinderella\nInstagram: http:\/\/instagram.com\/disneycinderella\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/CinderellaMovie\nTumblr: http:\/\/cinderellapastmidnight.tumblr.com\nPinterest: https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/disneystudi...","categoryId":"1"}

See Kaa\u2019s Jungle Through Mowgli\u2019s Eyes, a 360 Experience.\n\nSee the film in theatres April 15, 2016.\n\nDirected by Jon Favreau (\u201cIron Man\u201d), based on Rudyard Kipling\u2019s timeless stories and inspired by Disney\u2019s classic animated film, \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d is an all-new live-action epic adventure about Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi), a man-cub who\u2019s been raised by a family of wolves. But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba), who bears the scars of Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he\u2019s ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley), and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don\u2019t exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire. The all-star cast also includes Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf Raksha, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack\u2019s alpha male Akela. \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d seamlessly blends live-action with photorealistic CGI animals and environments, using up-to-the-minute technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an enchanting and lush world. The wild adventure swings into theaters in 3D on April 15, 2016.","categoryId":"1"}

Onze held is hotter than hot en zijn maatjes zijn maar wat trots op het succes van hun homie. Bij een vet platencontract hoort natuurlijk een vette auto. Die past helemaal bij zijn nieuwe sterrenstatus. Maar dan blijkt dat zelfs Young D niet altijd totally in control is. Tijd om Even Apeldoorn te (r)appen. \n\nDeze 59e Even Apeldoorn Bellen commercial werd gefilmd in Los Angeles, in de wijk Echo Park. Deze plek lijkt op de veel door rappers bezongen wijk Compton, maar is een stuk veiliger. De rap die je hoort is gemaakt door de producer van hiphop-ster Kanye West. Courtney Richards (Young D) nam zelf de vocals van \u2018Honk the horns\u2019 voor zijn rekening. Op de set was er ook nog een typisch \u2018Even Apeldoorn Bellen\u2019 moment. In take 6 rolde de auto van Young D de heuvel af, maar raakte onbedoeld een geparkeerde auto.\n\nOver Centraal Beheer:\n\nCentraal Beheer biedt particuliere en zakelijke klanten persoonlijk contact, zekerheid en gemak.

The campaign calls on journalists to spread awareness of this scourge and appeal to readers to sign a petition that will be personally handed to the French president during the 6th World Water Forum in March 2012.\r\n\r\nTo evoke the silent and invisible threat of unhealthy water, BDDP Unlimited opted for a minimalist approach that is both visually appealing and surprising, using water and ink exclusively. The spot shows the power of ink to reveal the invisible.\r\n\r\nThe spot, created by BDDP Unlimited, produced by Hush and directed by Cl\u00e9ment Beauvais, a young director, illustrator, musician and photographer. His multiple talents and mastery of various techniques enabled him to both create the drawings and direct the spot.\r\n\r\nThe campaign will be seen from mid-March on TV, in cinemas, on the Internet and in print. A dedicated web site, www.votregouttedeau.org, will gather signatures for the petition.","categoryId":"29"}

He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont\u2019s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard \u201cBernie\u201d Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s historic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city\u2019s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women\u2019s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a \u201cpractical and successful legislator,\u201d Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus\u2019 ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues, click here: https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/","categoryId":"25"}

And then you come around the bend and see the finish line and just give it all you have.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I love post-race; you\u2019re on a high all day long and your kids think you won because you come home with a medal. Post-race I love to adjust my bed to soften it a little bit. I feel my hips are a little tight from all of the racing and the biking and the jarring of the running. Diving into a softer bed, it\u2019s just so comfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun to look on your app, on your device, and look at how well you slept the night before. For some reason just knowing that number, that you IQ was better than your husband\u2019s, you\u2019re like my day is going to rock today. I love my Sleep Number. I don\u2019t think that there is another bed that could give me the quality sleep that I have.\u201d\n\nFind a Sleep Number\u00ae mattress store near you to find out how Sleep Number can help if you're having trouble sleeping: http:\/\/www.sleepnumber.com\/find-mattress-stores\n\nHear unbiased reviews from real people experiencing real rest with Sleep Number\u00ae by going to our channel & subscribing:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HHfTRz3NU-w&list=PLR6a2QUEJa7DMd1xgimde_ql4dPadh_TI \n\nLike us on Facebook to get the latest news on Sleep Number\u00ae: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SleepNumber","categoryId":"26"}

Just watch!","description":"Wanna have the DVD? Visit http:\/\/www.painteddesigns.nl\nIn July 2007, I received an email from Lew Wood, the actor who appears in this commercial. He tells:\n\nI am the guy tha D-D-B chose to be the spokesman for that famous \"Floating VW\" TV commercial in June , 1972.\nMy name is Lew Wood, and I was doing commercials and V\/O's in NYC when I was booked for the job. We shot it at a launching ramp in Stamford, CT on LI Sound. The production crew was Horn-Greiner. Director Norm Greiner. D-D-B's creative director was Tom Yobaggy. And even Mr. Bernbach was on the location!\nThey hired a stuntman to drive the VW into the water. However, Norm Greiner suddenly woke up to the fact that I had to deliver that last line \"Now, what other car gives you this kind of quality at this kind of price?\" from the car! I said, \"Norm, I'm a sailor, I'm at home on the water. I'll drive it in!\" \nI splashed it three times. (We used three identical Beetles, all burnt orange in color. Splashed two of them alternately, the third never got wet and was used for \"beauty shots.\" Swimmers went in to tow them back to shore after each take.\nWe all thought our commercial would win the \"Clio\" that year, but the \"Snowplow\" commercial took the prize.\nHowever, the residuals were nice!\nAfter many years of searching for a 1972 Super Beetle in burnt orange with NO RUST, I finally found one a few years ago in Vista, CA, and snapped it up. I now proudly drive around town frequently and get admiring looks.\nNow, you know \"the rest of the story!\"\n\nLew Wood died in August 2013, at the age of 84 years.\n\nThis commercial has a surprise in it. At the and you can watch a beetle being driven into the water. Funny is the text in the commercial says: allthough the beetle does definately float, it will not float indefinately. Fun!\n\nFrom the DVD 'Legend on wheels'. Wanna have this DVD packed with 2 hours of high quality digitally remastered old vw commercials? The DVD really brings you back to the '60s and '70s.

He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont\u2019s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard \u201cBernie\u201d Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s historic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city\u2019s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women\u2019s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a \u201cpractical and successful legislator,\u201d Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus\u2019 ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues, click here: https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/","categoryId":"25"}

More than half of these deaths occur in motor vehicles when people attempt to drive through flooded roadways.  This happens because people underestimate the force and power of water, especially when it is moving.  \n\nJust six inches of fast-moving water can knock over and carry off an adult. Twelve inches of water can float a small car. If that water is moving, it can carry that car away. Eighteen to twenty-four inches of flowing water can carry away most vehicles, including large SUVs. It is impossible to tell the exact depth of water covering a roadway or the condition of the road below the water. This is especially true at night when your vision is more limited.  It is never safe to drive or walk through flood waters. Any time you come to a flooded road, walkway, or path, follow this simple rule: Turn Around Don\u2019t Drown. \n\nFor more information and flood safety tips, visit www.floodsafety.noaa.gov.\nDownload in HD (1920x1080): http:\/\/go.usa.gov\/xW5yQ","categoryId":"28"}

It's a simple fact of life that our politicians are bought and paid for in the form of bribes aka \"campaign donations,\" and there is nobody more guilty of that than Hillary Clinton who is a corporate sellout of the worst kind. She has been bought and funded by Wall Street, large corporations including Monsanto and Private Prisons among others. \n\nInstead of being funded by Wall Street billionaires, private prisons and Super Pacs, Bernie Sanders is almost completely funded by US, the PEOPLE.

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state\u2019s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that \u201chuman rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all\u201d\u2014inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women\u2019s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn\u2019t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she\u2019s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she want to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton\u2019s YouTube Channel.

And when that last bell finally rings, there are plenty of places for kids and adults of all ages to get out and play.

Take a look around in this  360 experience!\n\nDisney\u2019s The Jungle Book opens in theatres April 15 in 3D! Get tickets: http:\/\/di.sn\/6008BjFgq\n\nDirected by Jon Favreau (\u201cIron Man\u201d), based on Rudyard Kipling\u2019s timeless stories and inspired by Disney\u2019s classic animated film, \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d is an all-new live-action epic adventure about Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi), a man-cub who\u2019s been raised by a family of wolves. But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba), who bears the scars of Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he\u2019s ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley), and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don\u2019t exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire. The all-star cast also includes Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf Raksha, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack\u2019s alpha male Akela. \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d seamlessly blends live-action with photorealistic CGI animals and environments, using up-to-the-minute technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an enchanting and lush world. The wild adventure swings into theaters in 3D on April 15, 2016. \n\nLike The Jungle Book on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DisneyJungleBook\nFollow The Jungle Book on Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheJungleBook\nFollow The Jungle Book on Instagram: https:\/\/instagram.com\/disneythejunglebook","categoryId":"1"}

Interactive Entertainment revealed today gameplay featuring everyone\u2019s favorite Mystery, Inc. characters in LEGO Dimensions, the upcoming entertainment experience that merges physical LEGO brick building with interactive console gameplay. For the first time in a LEGO videogame, the Scooby-Doo gameplay combines the distinctive, blocky LEGO art style with the cel-shaded look of the original, animated cartoons. The LEGO Dimensions Starter Pack includes a complete, mission-based Scooby-Doo level that Batman, Wyldstyle and Gandalf must traverse in their quest to stop Lord Vortech and save the LEGO Multiverse. \n\nFor Scooby-Doo fans that want to customize their LEGO Dimensions experience, it was also announced that a Scooby-Doo Team Pack which includes LEGO Scooby-Doo and LEGO Shaggy minifigures, plus a LEGO Mystery Machine and LEGO Scooby Snack, will be available at the launch of the Starter Pack.  \nScooby-Doo and Shaggy each have their own abilities and the Mystery Machine and Scooby Snack can be physically built and then rebuilt twice for a total of three different objects that do entirely different things in the digital game for massive variety. Either character can also unlock the Scooby-Doo Adventure World, an open-world environment which provides additional open world gameplay content separate from the game\u2019s main story which allows players to explore iconic Scooby-Doo locations, race, solve puzzles, and more.\nAll expansion packs provide gamers the opportunity to use every character, vehicle and gadget interchangeably, anywhere throughout the game. Players can bring up to seven toys into the LEGO Dimensions game all at once by placing them on the LEGO Toy Pad to create extreme gameplay cross-overs, such as Scooby-Doo piloting the Batmobile through Springfield! \n\nLaunching September 27, 2015, LEGO Dimensions will be available for Xbox One, the all-in one games and entertainment system from Microsoft and the Xbox 360 games and entertainment system from Microsoft, PlayStation4 and PlayStation3 computer entertainment systems and the Wii U system from Nintendo.\n\nFollow LEGO Dimensions at: Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LEGODimensions \nTwitter: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/LEGODimensions (@LEGODimensions)\nInstagram: http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/LEGODimensions (@LEGODimensions)\nTumblr: http:\/\/LEGODimensions.tumblr.com","categoryId":"20"}

Not only does poaching damage marine ecosystems, this piracy also hurts legitimate fishermen, who rely on a healthy ocean. What are the different types of illegal fishing? How this crime can make waves throughout the ocean and around the world. Watch and learn!\n\nCartoonist Jim Toomey\u2014whose daily comic strip, Sherman\u2019s Lagoon, is syndicated in more than 250 newspapers in the United States\u2014has joined forces with The Pew Charitable Trusts to illustrate \"illegal fishing\" and other terms associated with our oceans. \n\nWatch the full ocean terms video series: http:\/\/www.pewtrusts.org\/en\/research-and-analysis\/collections\/2016\/01\/cartoon-crash-course-a-visual-glossary-of-ocean-terminology \n \n \n*TRANSCRIPT*\n \nIllegal fishing. Maybe you\u2019ve done this before on a small scale. But large-scale illegal fishing refers to criminals using massive vessels to steal tons of fish from the ocean.\n\nThis can include exceeding a quota, fishing without a license, forging or doctoring licenses, using banned gear, or breaking any number of other fisheries laws. \n\nWorldwide, experts estimate that 1 in 5 wild caught marine fish is taken outside the law.\n\nThat adds up to 1800 pounds of stolen fish a second! \n\nIllegal fishing makes it really hard to estimate fish populations, which makes it difficult to manage fisheries and keep our oceans healthy. \n\nIt also damages marine ecosystems and is unfair to law abiding fishermen who play by the rules.\n\nIn some places, illegal fishing causes fisheries to collapse, threatening the food supply for millions of coastal residents around the world.\n\nThere you go!\n\nPewtrusts.org\/endillegalfishing","categoryId":"29"}

He replies, with what appears to be a Chinese accent, \"Ancient Chinese secret.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene changes to Mrs. Lee, who is in an adjoining room. Mrs. Lee appears ethnically Chinese, but she speaks English with a thoroughly American accent, and explains to the audience that her husband's \"ancient Chinese secret\" is that he uses Calgon water softener.\r\nMrs. Lee ultimately gives the secret away by sticking her head into the front room where Mr. Lee and the customer are standing, and shouts \"We need more Calgon!\" To which the customer replies \"Ancient Chinese secret, huh?\" while Mr. Lee accepts the exposure with good humor.\r\n\r\nThe actress playing Mrs. Lee, Anne Miyamoto, was actually Japanese-American.\r\n\r\nCalgon water softener adverts in the United Kingdom, Ireland and in the rest of Europe promote the product solely on the basis of saving washing machines from breakdown rather than any benefits to the clothing in the wash, although the products on sale are identical to those in the United States. In Portugal, the Calgon advertisement jingle is the same popular one, for almost 30 years. In Italy Calgon is called Calfort.","categoryId":"24"}

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state\u2019s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that \u201chuman rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all\u201d\u2014inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women\u2019s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn\u2019t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she\u2019s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she want to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton\u2019s YouTube Channel.

He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont\u2019s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard \u201cBernie\u201d Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s historic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city\u2019s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women\u2019s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a \u201cpractical and successful legislator,\u201d Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus\u2019 ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\n\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues, click here: https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/","categoryId":"25"}

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state\u2019s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that \u201chuman rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all\u201d\u2014inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women\u2019s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn\u2019t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she\u2019s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she want to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton\u2019s YouTube Channel.

It was famously used by teenagers as their first scent, competing with other market leaders Brut, Denim and Old Spice. As a unique marketing ploy, in the early days each bottle of Hai Karate came with a small self-defense instruction booklet, to help wearers defend themselves against women.\r\nHai Karate is also fondly remembered for its television adverts, which featured a stereotypical nerd covering himself in the substance and being seduced by a female passer-by played by Valerie Leon of Carry On films fame. The advertising catch phrase was \"Be careful how you use it\".\r\n\r\nVisit our RETRO BLOG:\r\nhttp:\/\/retroload.blogspot.com","categoryId":"1"}

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state\u2019s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that \u201chuman rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all\u201d\u2014inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women\u2019s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn\u2019t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she\u2019s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she want to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton\u2019s YouTube Channel.

As the biggest single buyer of palm oil in the world, Unilever has a special responsibility to help clean up the industry that's behind so much forest destruction.\r\n\r\nThey have agreed to support the call by Greenpeace for an immediate moratorium on deforestation for palm oil plantations.

He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont\u2019s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard \u201cBernie\u201d Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s historic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city\u2019s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women\u2019s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a \u201cpractical and successful legislator,\u201d Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus\u2019 ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues, click here: https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/","categoryId":"25"}

This component of the Christmas campaign will cement in Victorian motorists' minds the very real potential outcomes of drink driving and the potential consequences on not just the driver, but other road users, family and friends.\nThis execution was launch in early December 2011 and  ran on television throughout Victoria for the month of December, as well as cinema during the Christmas \/ New Year period.\nSignificant holiday periods produce high volumes of traffic on Victoria's major highways and arterial roads, often involving a change in travel patterns and use of unfamiliar roads. This involves inherent risk to the safety of Victorian road users. Historically the last 12 days of the year have resulted in the highest road fatality per day with an average of 14 deaths. This represents an average of 1.17 deaths per day, compared to an average of 0.87 deaths per day for the rest of the year.\n\nTransport Accident Commission Victoria.\nhttp:\/\/www.tac.vic.gov.au\n======================\n\"Copyright in the material on this website is owned by the TAC and may only be used for non-commercial personal or educational purposes.

Another chance to go down in history: Nico Rosberg and Mercedes seized the opportunity to secure the first grand prix victory in Azerbaijan, Williams dominated the DHL Fastest Pit Stop Award again, producing one of the fastest Formula 1 pit stops ever!\n\nEight races, eight fastest pit stops: Williams left the competition no chance in Baku. Three of the four fastest stops went to the team from Grove. Only Red Bull Racing got in the way of a Williams hat-trick with the stop for Daniel Ricciardo.\n\nBut Williams not only achieved the fastest pit stop in the still nascent Formula 1 history of Azerbaijan, the team also matched the previous world record with a record stop of 1.92 seconds (Felipe Massa)! The previous top time was a stop by Red Bull driver Mark Webber in the 2013 United States Grand Prix, also in the record time of 1.92 seconds.\n\nA look at the timesheet shows just how much the unbeaten Williams series of best times is driving the other teams to achieve similar top performances: 21 of the 33 pit stops during the 2016 FORMULA 1 GRAND PRIX OF EUROPE were below the magic three-second benchmark figure! This shows once again that the #GreatIsInTheDetail motto could not be more apt where Formula 1 pit stops are concerned!","categoryId":"28"}

The highly anticipated commercial crowning the 2-year campaign, premiers worldwide across multiple platforms today, February 6th.\n \nMarc Atlan Design \u2014 in a close collaboration with H&M's Creative Director & David Beckham's team \u2014 developed the concept, design and execution of the Spring 2013 TV Commercial that was shot on location in Los Angeles. This included writing the original script, designing the campaign, and proposing to work with acclaimed film director Guy Ritchie. The commercial features an action-packed, fast paced scenario of David Beckham running through the streets of Beverly Hills.\n \nAtlan originated the idea of teaming up soccer star & fashion icon David Beckham with H&M back in March 2011. Since the project's inception, Marc has partnered with this high-octane team to generate the look and feel of every creative detail including the billboards, packagings, shopping bags and collection catalogue.\n \n\u2015I'm so grateful to H&M, David Beckham, his team & Guy Ritchie for granting me the creative freedom to conceptualize a sexy yet sophisticated international ad campaign,\u2016 says Atlan. \u2015I can't think of a better way to celebrate 25 successful years in the creative industry than with the worldwide launch of this short movie directed by Guy Ritchie","categoryId":"26"}

The idea came from Ron Travisano, at the advertising agency of Della Femina Travisano and Partners, who had the account with Ralston Purina in 1974. Travisano put together film footage with editor Jay Gold, looping images of a cat to make it look like it was singing. The music was then composed by Tom McFaul of the jingle house Lucas\/McFaul, one of the major jingle-composing houses at the time. Working from Travisano's film, McFaul wrote and produced music to fit, with the actual meowing performed by professional singer Linda November.[3][4]\n\nTravisano then came up with the idea of adding English subtitles, along with a bouncing ball pointing out the words.[5]\"","categoryId":"15"}

Vehicles tear upside-down through loops and tubes, launch off ramps with extra propulsion from speed strips, diverge and merge across multiple pathways, and speed through gigantic rings of fire in death-defying new Races.\n\nThe jumps, gaps, terrain, and obstacles in each Race are tailored to match the attributes of specific vehicle classes, including new Super cars, Sports cars and Motorbikes. And of course, racing livery-clad vehicles deserve appropriately tatted and dressed drivers, sporting new motocross gear, racing suits, helmets and host of other additions.

The only hope of stopping it rests on the shoulders of the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) and his formidable Secret Service head (Gerard Butler), and an English MI-6 agent (Charlotte Riley) who rightly trusts no one.

Shocking speeding advert shows children getting crushed by car","description":"Subscribe to ITN News: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1bmWO8h\nA shocking road safety advert shows a car smash through a wall and kill a classroom of children. The video starts with children at school playing and preparing to leave for a school trip, whilst a man grabs his breakfast at home and heads out in his car. As the children play in the park, we see the man lose control of his car and crash through a wall. However, on the other side of the wall are the children. The car flips through the air, landing on them and crushing them instantly. The Northern Ireland road safety ad was made to highlight the dangers of speeding after figures showed 28 children have died from it since 2000. Road safety minister Mark Durkan insisted the advert was 'sensitive'.

Don't drive blind","description":"On 27 February 2013, the TAC launched a new mass media public education campaign targeting distracted road users. The campaign highlights the dangers of taking your eyes off the road for just two seconds.\n\nInternational research into road user distractions has established the 'eyes off the road' time theory as a major contributor to crash risks resulting in trauma. \n\nThe 'eyes off the road' time is generally defined as two seconds plus, the average person's reaction time to an event is 1.8 seconds and this is factored into crash probability and injury outcome severity. That means nearly four seconds can pass before the average 'distracted' driver can react.\n\nWith more devices and distractions available to us than ever, the latest campaign shows how quickly inattention can end in disaster. \nThe campaign will appear on a number of different media including TV, radio, outdoor, online and ambient.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.tacsafety.com.au\/campaigns\/distractions\n\nTransport Accident Commission Victoria.\nhttps:\/\/www.tac.vic.gov.au\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TransportAccidentCommission \nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/TACVictoria \n\n======================\n\n\"Copyright in the material on this website is owned by the TAC and may only be used for non-commercial personal or educational purposes.

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state\u2019s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that \u201chuman rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all\u201d\u2014inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women\u2019s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn\u2019t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she\u2019s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton\u2019s YouTube Channel.

Help em out by referring a friend in the High Point NC area, or drop by the store yourself to meet Richard, Johnny, and the gang!\n\nTo address any controversy around this video, watch our video response (or read the transcript below):\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BnH8eiSfyKg\n\nWe knew this video was going to be controversial.  Anytime race is discussed in any capacity, controversy ensues.  The racial reconciliation concept was a joint effort between the Red House staff and us.  They pointed out the fact that their employees and customer base were like the \"Rainbow Coalition\", and we thought something with a comical racial reconciliation theme would be fun, as well as a conversation starter.\n\nFor those of you who think this video is racist, we'd like you to distinguish between \"racist\" and \"racial\".  Racism is \"hatred or intolerance of another race or other races.\"  Racial is \"of, relating to, or based on a race\".  This video is very obviously racial as opposed to racist.  This video doesn't promote or feature hatred or intolerance.  Rather, it's the very opposite.  This commercial promotes inclusion and reconciliation, if not in a comical way.  To point out the obvious, the irony in this video is that it's completely ridiculous for people to relate furniture to their race.  People of all colors are welcome at the Red House, which is something that is taken for granted today, but there was a time in the not-so-distant past during which things as simple as a water fountain were NOT for everyone.\n\nIf Saturday Night Live, Mad TV, or Dave Chappelle for that matter, were to address racial issues in a comical way (something that they all do VERY regularly), they would have pushed the envelope MUCH further.\n\nDiscussing race in the US is taboo.  It always makes people feel uncomfortable.  We think it's a shame that someone saying \"I'm white\" or \"I'm black\" creates such a stir.  There are real cultural identities within different people groups, and these things should be celebrated and embraced, not swept under the rug. \n\nThis video is an attempt to use humor to spark a discussion about race issues, because we still have a long way to go.\n\nRhett&Link","categoryId":"23"}

From QNX, the operating system so stable, secure and fast that it's relied upon by the likes of NASA to ensure the safety of human life in mission critical systems, to The Astonishing Tribe, who design the most beautiful and functional interfaces the world has ever seen. Years of investment, innovation, hard work and the intense pursuit of our passion is finally about to bear its fruit... \n\n...an all new flawless mobile experience -- solid; secure; beautiful.

He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont\u2019s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard \u201cBernie\u201d Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s historic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city\u2019s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women\u2019s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a \u201cpractical and successful legislator,\u201d Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus\u2019 ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues, click here: https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/","categoryId":"25"}

This coffee is criminal!\" as he throws a cup of his wife's coffee into a bed of petunias. Then, he obnoxiously berates his wife while sticking his finger in her face saying, \"Admit it! Your coffee really is murder!\" The wife goes to a European-accented old man in the grocery store and says, \"Papa Eddie, it's my coffee--it's murder!\" Papa Eddie is the male version of Mrs. Olsen, another Folger's coffee pusher. The obvious and equitable solution--the husband making his own coffee--is never considered by either party. The assumption that the wife's role is to please her man to his satisfaction is never questioned.\n\nYou know, I never quite got the whole concept of \"mountain grown\", much less the concept of a mountain. Is a mountain round? Is it square? Or perhaps they are shaped like an amoeba?  Well, Papa Eddie sets the record straight here with an easy to remember hand signal which clearly indicates mountains are in fact triangular in shape. I wonder what ad man thought up THAT brilliant idea.","categoryId":"1"}

Johnson's campaign. Though only aired once (by the campaign), it is considered a factor in Johnson's landslide victory over Barry Goldwater and an important turning point in political and advertising history. It was created by Tony Schwartz of Doyle Dane Bernbach. It remains one of the most controversial political advertisements ever made.\n\n\"Daisy\" (4 year old Monique M. Corzilius)  aired only once, during a September 7, 1964 telecast of David and Bathsheba on The NBC Monday Movie. Johnson's campaign was widely criticized for using the prospect of nuclear war, as well as for the implication that Goldwater would start one, to frighten voters. The ad was immediately pulled, but the point was made, appearing on the nightly news and on conversation programs in its entirety. Jack Valenti, who served as a special assistant to Johnson, later suggested that pulling the ad was a calculated move, arguing that \"it showed a certain gallantry on the part of the Johnson campaign to withdraw the commercial.\" Johnson's line \"We must either love each other, or we must die\" echoes W. H. Auden's poem \"September 1, 1939\" in which line 88 reads, \"We must love one another or die.\" The words \"children\" and \"the dark\" also occur in Auden's poem.\n\nIn 1984, Walter Mondale's unsuccessful presidential campaign used ads with a similar theme to the Daisy ad. Mondale's advertisements cut between footage of children and footage of ballistic missiles and nuclear explosions, over a soundtrack of the song \"Teach Your Children\" by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (source: Wikipedia)\n\nFurther info on  Monique M.

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state\u2019s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that \u201chuman rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all\u201d\u2014inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women\u2019s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn\u2019t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she\u2019s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton\u2019s YouTube Channel.

Do you think it is your best yet?\n\nIt was definitely more difficult than my other works, it was difficult to find the perfect position and it was quite hard for the models to hold the positions, from time to time they needed a break. Also it was difficult because the wolf is a mammalian and it has a coat, which is much more difficult to paint and to make seem realistic than for example the skin of an amphibian or a reptil.\n\nThe painting was one of my longest as well. From the beginning to the final photo I spend 8 hours in my studio. In the middle we spent at least 1 hour to correct the position again and again, the pure painting time was about 6 hours.\n\nThe first sketch took me just a few minutes, but it took 4 hours to check out the position with the models before the actual painting, it was my longest position test ever.\n\nIt is hard to say if the wolf is my best yet, but I am sure it is not less spectacular than my other animal illusions. Besides a wolf is an animal which generally attracts a lot of people.\n\nHow did you make the background of this work?\n\nThe background is painted with acrylic color on cardboard, partly with brushes, partly with spray cans. It hangs on the wall and continues on the ground.\n\nWhat has the feedback from people been?\n\nActually many of the peolple who already saw the wolf say that it is my best work. Generally everybody likes it. People are fascinated and they say that it is even more difficult to find the people than in my other works. Recently I showed the wolf in public for the 1st time at my exhibition in Switzerland and it emerged as \"the star\" of the exhibition.\n\nHow do you make your animals so realistic?\n\nI draw and paint since my early childhood and animals always belonged to my main motives and main themes. I always loved animals and apart from painting them I watched out for them in the nature, observed them well, studied them in books and photographed them. I am sure that all this helped me to develop my feeling and knowledge about animals. A deep knowledge and understanding about animals is one of many necessary aspects for the ability to create bodypainting works like this.","categoryId":"22"}

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.\n \nMajor League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues.

He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont\u2019s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBernard \u201cBernie\u201d Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s historic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n\nAfter graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city\u2019s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women\u2019s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a \u201cpractical and successful legislator,\u201d Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus\u2019 ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nKnown for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\n\nTo learn more about Bernie on the issues, click here: https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/","categoryId":"25"}
